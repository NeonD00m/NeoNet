# NeoNet

NeoNet is a networking module made to combine simple API with advanced utility.

## Goals

- Simple, obvious API
- Performant
- Eliminating OOP and instances to save time for the developer
- Steal all the cool ideas and modules from other libraries so that this is the best in every way.

## Non-goals

- Many similar libraries, complicate the api a lot and result in having massive function calls to setup up remotes for the game, which is why simply calling :Connect for example will create the remote.
- I don't want to provide a library that is bad.

<!-- ## Performance today

NeoNet currently achieves an average frame time of ___ms spent inside NeoNet code for the following benchmark: -->

<!-- - World with 1000 entities
- Between 2-30 components on each entity
- 300 unique component types
- 200 systems
- Each system queries between 1 and 10 components -->
